You are analyzing a daily hotel industry newsletter email. Your task is to parse this newsletter and extract individual articles/news items from it.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the entire newsletter content carefully
2. Identify each distinct article, news item, or story in the newsletter
3. For each article, extract:
   - A sequential article number (starting from 1)
   - The complete article text (preserve the full content)
   - A headline/title for the article (use the actual headline if present, or create a concise summary headline)

GUIDELINES:
- Newsletters typically contain 5-15 separate articles/news items
- Each article should be a complete, self-contained news item
- Preserve all relevant details including names, numbers, locations, and dates
- Do not combine multiple articles into one
- Do not split a single article into multiple parts
- Skip newsletter headers, footers, subscription info, and advertisements
- Focus on substantive news content about hotels, hospitality, real estate, and related industries

Return a JSON array of article objects. Each object should have:
- article_number: integer (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- headline: string (concise title for the article)
- article_text: string (complete article content)

Example output format:
